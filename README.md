# My Quiz
A dynamic quiz application built with React.js and powered by the Open Trivia DB API.
This project demonstrates API integration, error handling with retries, and state-driven UI updates‚Äîall documented with reproducibility in mind.
## Feature
- Fetches quiz questions from an external API with retry logic and exponential backoff for rate limits.
- Dynamic question flow with score tracking and final results.
- Answer validation with visual feedback (correct/incorrect states).
- User-friendly error handling for API failures and rate limits.
- Clean, modular React code with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`).
## Tech Stack
- React.js (with Vite for fast dev environment)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Open Trivia DB API
- CSS for styling

## Learning Highlights
This project helped me grow as both a developer and a technical writer:
- Implemented API management strategies (retry, exponential backoff).
- Documented common developer pain points (rate limits, error handling).
- Strengthened debugging practices with state tracing and logs.
- Created reproducible documentation to help others extend the project.
## Future Enhancements
- Add category/level selection for quizzes.
- Persist scores with local storage or backend integration.
- Improve UI/UX with animations and accessibility features.
